## What is Better Pay?

Better Pay is a unified, developer-first payment integration layer that supports multiple payment providers. Designed for flexibility, and simplicity, it helps you manage payment flows without diving deep into each provider's APIs. Whether you're building SaaS, e-commerce, or custom apps â€” Better pay is streamlines the whole payment process for you.

## Get Started

  ```

2. Initialise the provider

## STRIPE
 Get started with our sample demo app integrated with stripe. [Demo](https://github.com/Muhammad-Owais-Warsi/stripe-demo)


1. Initialise the provider
```
import { BetterPay } from "better-pay";
   
const provider = new BetterPay({
  provider: "stripe",
  apiKey: "API_KEY_FOR_STRIPE" 
})

```

2. **Create Payment**
   
After initializing the provider:
 ```
const response = await provider.createPayment({
  amount: 10000,
  currency: 'usd',
  receiptEmail: 'test@gmail.com', // optional
  metadata: {} // optional
})

```
This returns a `client_secret`. Send it to your frontend where the customer will enter their card details using Stripe Elements.

**NOTE**  

Supports card elements only.

3. Confirm Payment

```
const response = await provider.confirmPayment({
  paymentIntentId: YOUR_PAYMENT_INTENT_ID,
  paymentMethodId: YOUR_PAYMENT_METHOD_ID,
  returnUrl: YOUR_RETURN_URL_AFTER_SUCCESSFULL_PAYMENT

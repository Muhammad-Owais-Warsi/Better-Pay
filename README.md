## What is Better Pay?

Better Pay is a unified, developer-first payment integration layer that supports multiple payment providers. Designed for flexibility, and simplicity, it helps you manage payment flows without diving deep into each provider's APIs. Whether you're building SaaS, e-commerce, or custom apps â€” Better pay is streamlines the whole payment process for you.

## Integration Support 
- Stripe
- Coming Soon...

## Get Started

1. Installation
  ``` 
  npm i better-pay
  ```

2. Initialise the provider
```
import { BetterPay } from "better-pay";
   
const provider = new BetterPay({
  provider: "stripe" // or any provider
  apiKey: "API_KEY_FOR_STRIPE" 
})
```
---

**NOTE**  
For any provider there are two functions: 
- Create Payment: to create your order, intent or payment.
- Confirm Payment: to confirm your payment.
---


## STRIPE
 Get started with our sample demo app integrated with stripe. [Demo]()


1. **Create Payment**
   
After initializing the provider:
 ```
const response = await provider.createPayment({
  amount: 10000,
  currency: 'usd'
})

```
This returns a `client_secret`. Send it to your frontend where the customer will enter their card details using Stripe Elements.

---

**NOTE**  

Supports card elements only.

---

4. Confirm Payment

Once you have the `payment_method_id` from the frontend:

```
const response = await provider.confirmPayment({
  paymentIntentId: YOUR_PAYMENT_INTENT_ID,
  paymentMethodId: YOUR_PAYMENT_METHOD_ID,
  returnUrl: YOUR_RETURN_URL_AFTER_SUCCESSFULL_PAYMENT
})

```
